# Encryptbot

Encryptbot create a Let's Encrypt SSL certificate with multiple wildcard domains that is managed in Heroku.

The gem will:

- Create a Let's Encrypt Certificate
- Add Let's Encrypt DNS Challenge TXT records for domains managed in AWS Route 53
- Add the certificate to a Heroku SNI endpoint

## Pre-setup

1. Using AWS Route 53, create a Hosted Zone
2. Create an AWS IAM user with the following permissions and get an API access key and secret.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "route53:ChangeResourceRecordSets",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:route53:::hostedzone/YOUR_ZONE_NAME_ID_HERE"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor1",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "route53:GetChange",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:route53:::change/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

3. Add a CNAME called "_acme-challenege" pointing to your Route 53 name. If you're using Cloudflare, turn off proxying.
4. You're now ready to go.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'encryptbot'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install encryptbot


## Usage

Add an initializer file to your rails application and all applicable config settings.

```ruby
Encryptbot.configure do |config|
  config.heroku_app = "heroku_app_name"
  config.heroku_token = "heroku_api_token"
  config.acme_email = "letsencrypt_account_email@email.com"
  config.route53_hosted_zone_id = "Z123456"
  config.route53_acme_record_name = "_acme-challenge.acme.domain.com"
  config.route53_access_key_id = "aws_api_key"
  config.route53_secret_access_key = "aws_api_secret"
  config.domains = ["*.domain1.com", "*.domain2.com"]
end
```

Request initial certificate
```ruby
heroku run rails encryptbot:add_cert
```

Once the certificate has been initially setup, you can schedule the rake task to run every 30 days.
